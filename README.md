## SwiftyCMS
### A content management system build in Swift

#### Author: [Alexander Trust](https://sajonara.de)

It all started as a [Vapor-Project](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/). Vapor is a Framework using Apples Swift programming language to create Server-Side-Apps. In that respect it is similar to Ruby on Rails, and others.

The goal of the project is to present a thorough web implementation of some data models and add Apps for iOS and macOS to it. In the end you should be able to add photos to your CMS by taking pictures with your iPhone or manage texts, galleries and information via an editor on the Mac. I chose this approach because it is way more comfortable than a web app.

But the web app will be the first step in the whole project. So you could use the CMS in a similar matter as you would Wordpress, Drupal or others.
